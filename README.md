# advent-of-code-2022
My solutions to the 2022 edition Advent of Code.

### Personal Challenge:
My personal challenge is just as last year:

Try to solve every day in a different programming language and see how far I get.

### I will be listing here which language I used for which day:

- **Day 1**: Elixir - I already wish I could solve more days in Elixir. It seems nice.
- **Day 2**: -

### Languages I plan to use in no particular order:
- C
- C++
- C#
- Rust
- Nim
- Java
- Vala
- Haxe
- Kotlin
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript *(Yes, I'm counting this separately. I need as many languages as possible)*
- Lua
- Teal *(Yup, again. Counting it separately)*
- Haskell
- Scala
- Prolog
- Elixir
- Bash *(No I'm not so cheap as to count POSIX shell separately)*
- x86 AT&T Assembly
- Go
- Dart
- CoffeeScript
- PureScript
- *Maybe torture myself by trying to solve one with* Brainfuck?
- *Maybe* Swift
- *Maybe* R
- *Maybe* Fortran
